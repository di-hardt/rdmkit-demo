Tool Assemblies are examples of combining  tools to cover data management tasks across several stages of the data life cycle. These can be tools that one or several communities combine to support RDM that can be picked up or accessed and used by others. The assemblies are aimed for users in a specific location and/or for users within a specific domain.
